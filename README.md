# Pursuit-Evasion

The aim of the research was to develop study algorithms for pursuers in a zero sum Pursuit Evasion Game, especially focussing on Voronoi Tessallation based algorithm and develop a similar algorithm with lesser computation. This repository contains the simulations for the Voronoi and the new algorithm developed using Pygame

The red player in the simulations is the evader and the blue are the pursuers. We used a Virtual Potential Field for the evader motion.

Our algorithm uses the geometric shape of the polygon formed by all players in the game, and their properties (Perimeter, Excenter, Area, etc)
